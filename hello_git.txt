This is a test file to play around with github.
Mostly test the VS Code features of git.
Will be modifying this file from Vs Code and from github itself and doing pulls & pushes.

1. create a repository on github
2. copy its url - we'll need it on vs code
3. vsc (vscode): open project folder
4. vsc: click on source control icon on left bar
5. vsc: click on "+" icon on top & select project folder
6. source control will show the number of files to commit
7. enter message/description of what the commit is about
8. click the check mark on top to commit the changes
9. command palette: git add remote
10. push the committed changes to github: source control "..." & push or cloud icon at bottom bar
